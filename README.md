## Project Overview
 

## Challenge Summary
Because some employees may had multiple titles in the database, I used the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contained the most recent title of each employee. Then, used the COUNT() function to create a table that had the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. Finally, included only current employees in the analysis by excluding those employees who had already left the company.
